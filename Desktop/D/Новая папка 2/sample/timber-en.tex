Construction wood can be divided into two commercial types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item solid;
    \item glued laminated.
\end{itemize}
The parameters required for resistance assessment are as follows
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f_{mk}$: flexural strength;
    \item $f_{t0k}$: tensile strength parallel to the fibre;
    \item $f_{1,90,k}$: tensile strength perpendicular to the fibre;
    \item $f_{c0k}$: compressive strength parallel to the fibre;
    \item $f_{c,90,k}$: compressive strength perpendicular to the fibre;
    \item $f_{vk}$: shear strength;
    \item $E_{0mean}$: modulus of elasticity parallel to the fibre;
    \item $E_{0.05}$: modulus of elasticity parallel to the fibre;
    \item $E_{90mean}$: modulus of elasticity perpendicular to the fibre;
    \item $G_{mean}$: modulus of elasticity parallel to the fibre;
\end{itemize}
They must be determined according to the stress state of the material.
More information about wood as a building material, strength and deformability tests are given in Eurocode 5. \cite{wsxbiblio_en1995}.
