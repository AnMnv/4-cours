Forming a composite of a material with (normal) positive thermal expansion with a material with (anomalous) negative thermal expansion can permit or accommodate thermal expansion of composites, or even have composites with thermal expansion close to zero. Thus, negative and positive thermal expansion cancel each other up to a certain value when the temperature changes. Adjustment of the total coefficient of thermal expansion to a certain value can be achieved by changing the volume fraction of various materials that contribute to the thermal expansion of the composite. In particular, in engineering there is a need for materials with CTE close to zero, that is, with fixed characteristics over a wide temperature range, for example, for use in precision instruments, compensators and in technology to control the properties of thin films with certain characteristics. Also in everyday life, materials with a CTE close to zero are required. Glass ceramic hobs, such as Ceran hobs, have to withstand large temperature fluctuations and rapid temperature changes during cooking because only certain parts of the hobs will heat up while other parts remain close to ambient temperature. As a rule, due to its fragility due to temperature differences, cracks can occur in the glass. However, glass ceramics used in hobs are made up of several different phases, some with positive and some with negative thermal expansion. The expansion of the different phases compensates for each other, so that the volume of the glass ceramic does not change much with temperature changes and cracks are prevented.

An example of the need for materials with a given thermal expansion in everyday life is dental fillings. If the fillings tend to expand beyond the size of the teeth, for example when drinking a hot or cold drink, it can cause toothache. However, if dental fillings are made from a composite material containing a mixture of materials with positive and negative thermal expansion, then the overall expansion can be closely matched to the expansion of the tooth enamel.
